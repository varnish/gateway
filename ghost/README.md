# Varnish Module (VMOD) `ghost`

Ghost VMOD - Gateway API routing for Varnish

Ghost is a purpose-built Varnish VMOD for Kubernetes Gateway API implementation.
It handles virtual host routing, backend selection, and configuration hot-reloading.

### Features

- **Virtual host routing**: Route requests based on the Host header
- **Exact hostname matching**: `api.example.com`
- **Wildcard hostname matching**: `*.staging.example.com` (single label only, per Gateway API spec)
- **Weighted backend selection**: Distribute traffic across backends by weight
- **Hot configuration reload**: Update routing without restarting Varnish
- **Default backend fallback**: Catch-all for unmatched requests
- **Native backends**: Uses Varnish's built-in HTTP client for optimal performance

### Minimal VCL Example

```vcl
vcl 4.1;

import ghost;

backend dummy { .host = "127.0.0.1"; .port = "80"; }

sub vcl_init {
## Initialize ghost with the configuration file path
ghost.init("/etc/varnish/ghost.json");

## Create the ghost backend router
new router = ghost.ghost_backend();
}

sub vcl_recv {
## Intercept reload requests (localhost only) and bypass cache
if (req.url == "/.varnish-ghost/reload" && (client.ip == "127.0.0.1" || client.ip == "::1")) {
return (pass);
}
}

sub vcl_backend_fetch {
## Use ghost for backend selection based on Host header
## Ghost handles reload requests internally, returning 200/500 status
set bereq.backend = router.backend();
}

sub vcl_backend_error {
## Handle cases where ghost director returns no backend
if (beresp.status == 503) {
set beresp.http.Content-Type = "application/json";
synthetic({"{"error": "Backend selection failed"}"});
}
return (deliver);
}
```

### Configuration File Format (ghost.json)

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "vhosts": {
    "api.example.com": {
      "routes": [
        {
          "path_match": {"type": "PathPrefix", "value": "/v1"},
          "backends": [
            {"address": "10.0.0.1", "port": 8080, "weight": 100},
            {"address": "10.0.0.2", "port": 8080, "weight": 100}
          ],
          "priority": 100
        },
        {
          "backends": [
            {"address": "10.0.0.3", "port": 8080, "weight": 100}
          ],
          "priority": 0
        }
      ]
    },
    "*.staging.example.com": {
      "routes": [
        {
          "backends": [
            {"address": "10.0.2.1", "port": 8080, "weight": 100}
          ],
          "priority": 100
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Routes are evaluated by priority (highest first). Path matching supports `Exact`, `PathPrefix`, and `RegularExpression` types. A route without `path_match` matches all paths for that vhost.

### Error Handling

When no backend is found (no vhost match and no default), the director returns `None`,
causing Varnish to trigger `vcl_backend_error` with status 503. Handle this in your VCL
to provide appropriate error responses.

### Hot Reload

Trigger a configuration reload by sending:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost/.varnish-ghost/reload
```

Returns HTTP 200 on success, HTTP 500 on failure (with error in `x-ghost-error` header).
The reload happens within the director, creating new backends as needed while preserving
existing connections for unchanged backends.

```vcl
// Place import statement at the top of your VCL file
// This loads vmod from a standard location
import ghost;

// Or load vmod from a specific file
import ghost from "path/to/libghost.so";
```

### Function `VOID ghost.init(STRING path)`

Initialize ghost with a configuration file path.

This function must be called in `vcl_init` before creating any ghost backends.
It loads and validates the JSON configuration file.

#### Arguments

* `path` - Absolute path to the ghost configuration JSON file

#### Errors

Returns an error if the configuration file cannot be read or contains invalid JSON.

#### Example

```vcl
sub vcl_init {
ghost.init("/etc/varnish/ghost.json");
}
```

### Function `STRING ghost.recv()`

Pre-routing hook for `vcl_recv`.

This function is reserved for future URL rewriting and pre-routing logic.
Currently returns `None` (no action). Reload handling has moved to the
director for cleaner separation.

#### Returns

- `None` - no action, continue normal request processing

#### Future Use

This will be used for:
- URL normalization/rewriting
- Authentication checks
- Rate limiting intercepts

### Constructor `ghost.ghost_backend()`

Ghost backend object for request routing.

The ghost backend routes requests to upstream servers based on the
Host header and the loaded configuration. It performs weighted random
selection when multiple backends are available for a virtual host.

Uses the director pattern with Varnish native backends for optimal
performance and connection pooling.

#### Example

```vcl
sub vcl_init {
ghost.init("/etc/varnish/ghost.json");
new router = ghost.ghost_backend();
}

sub vcl_backend_fetch {
set bereq.backend = router.backend();
}
```

Create a new ghost backend instance.

Must be called after `ghost.init()` has been called. This creates
a director that manages native Varnish backends for all endpoints
in the configuration.

##### Errors

Returns an error if `ghost.init()` has not been called first, or if
any backend creation fails.

#### Method `BACKEND <object>.backend()`

Get the VCL backend for use in `vcl_backend_fetch`.

When this backend is used, ghost will:
1. Match the request's Host header against configured virtual hosts
2. Select a backend using weighted random selection
3. Return a native Varnish backend pointer for the selected endpoint
4. Varnish handles the actual HTTP request and connection pooling

If no backend is found, returns `None` which causes `vcl_backend_error`
with status 503.

##### Safety

This function returns a raw VCL_BACKEND pointer that must only be used
within VCL backend fetch context. The pointer is valid for the lifetime
of the ghost_backend object.

##### Example

```vcl
sub vcl_backend_fetch {
set bereq.backend = router.backend();
}
```

#### Method `BOOL <object>.reload()`

Reload the configuration for this ghost backend.

Reloads the ghost.json configuration file and updates routing state.
New backends are created as needed, existing backends are preserved
for connection pooling.

##### Returns

- `true` on success
- `false` on failure

##### Example

```vcl
sub vcl_recv {
if (req.url == "/.varnish-ghost/reload" && (client.ip == "127.0.0.1" || client.ip == "::1")) {
if (router.reload()) {
return (synth(200, "OK"));
} else {
return (synth(500, "Reload failed"));
}
}
}
```
