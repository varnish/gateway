# Chaperone RBAC - ClusterRole and ClusterRoleBinding
#
# The chaperone needs cluster-wide access to EndpointSlices because:
# - HTTPRoutes can reference backend Services in any namespace (cross-namespace routing)
# - The chaperone watches EndpointSlices cluster-wide to discover backend pod IPs
#
# The operator creates a ServiceAccount for each Gateway ({gateway-name}-chaperone),
# but the ClusterRoleBinding below grants permissions to all service accounts in
# the varnish-gateway-system namespace.
#
# If you deploy Gateways in other namespaces, add additional ClusterRoleBindings
# for those namespaces.
