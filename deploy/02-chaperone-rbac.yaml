# As of the automatic RBAC implementation, the operator now creates
# namespace-scoped Role and RoleBinding resources automatically for each Gateway.
# This means chaperone pods get permissions to watch EndpointSlices and Services
# in their namespace without requiring manual RBAC setup.
#
# The ClusterRole below is defined for reference, showing what permissions
# chaperone needs. The static ClusterRoleBinding to the default namespace
# is deprecated and can be removed if you're not using it.
#
# For each Gateway, the operator automatically creates:
# - Role: {gateway-name}-chaperone (in the Gateway's namespace)
# - RoleBinding: {gateway-name}-chaperone (linking the Role to the ServiceAccount)
#
# These resources are owned by the Gateway and cleaned up automatically when
# the Gateway is deleted.

# ClusterRole for reference - shows permissions needed by chaperone
# (Operator creates namespace-scoped Roles with these same permissions)
